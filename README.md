## üöÄ Overview
This project models volatility dynamics and hidden market regimes in both traditional equities (SPY) and crypto (BTC-USD).  
It combines:
- GARCH-family conditional volatility modeling (GARCH, EGARCH, GJR-GARCH)
- Hidden Markov Models (HMM) for regime switching
- Forecast evaluation of 1-day-ahead volatility

---

## üß† Motivation
Volatility is not constant ‚Äî markets shift between calm and turbulent states.  
BTC, in particular, demonstrates persistent high-volatility regimes, unlike SPY‚Äôs fast-reverting volatility cycles.

This repo offers reproducible research that highlights:
- Volatility clustering patterns  
- Hidden regime persistence  
- Model-based forecast diagnostics
